    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample application demonstrates how a smart video IoT solution may be created using Intel® hardware and software tools to perform safety gear detection.  This solution detects any number of objects within a video frame looking specifically for people, safety vests, and hardhats. \n",
    "\n",
    "The results for each frame are stored in a text file that is later read by a second pass to annotate the input video with boxes around detected objects with a label and probability value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key concepts\n",
    "This sample application includes an example for the following:\n",
    "- Application:\n",
    "  - Video and image input is supported using OpenCV\n",
    "  - OpenCV is used to draw bounding boxes around detected objects, labels, and other information\n",
    "  - Visualization of the resulting bounding boxes in the output\n",
    "  - Uses the [Async API](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_IE_DG_Intro_to_Performance.html) feature of the Inference Engine (see [Object Detection Sample](../object-detection-python/object_detection.ipynb) for more details)\n",
    "- Intel® DevCloud for the Edge:\n",
    "  - Submitting inference as jobs that are performed on different edge compute nodes (rather than on the development node hosting this Jupyter* notebook)\n",
    "  - Monitoring job status\n",
    "  - Viewing results and assessing performance for hardware on different compute nodes\n",
    "- [Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit](https://software.intel.com/openvino-toolkit):\n",
    "  - Create the necessary Intermediate Representation (IR) files for the inference model using the [Model Downloader](http://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_tools_downloader_README.html) and [Model Optimizer](http://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_MO_DG_Deep_Learning_Model_Optimizer_DevGuide.html)\n",

    "## Safety gear detection application\n",
    "The safety gear detection application uses the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit to perform inference on an input video to locate people, safety vests, and hardhats within each frame.  We will setup, run, and view the results for this application for several different hardware devices (CPU. GPU, etc.) available on the compute nodes within the Intel® DevCloud for the Edge.  To accomplish this, we will be performing the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the [Model Optimizer](http://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_MO_DG_Deep_Learning_Model_Optimizer_DevGuide.html) to create the model IR files in the necessary precisions\n",
    "2. Create the job file used to submit running inference on compute nodes\n",
    "3. Submit jobs for different compute nodes and monitor the job status until complete\n",
    "4. View results and assess performance \n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works\n",
    "At startup the safety gear detection application configures itself by parsing the command line arguments and reading the specified labels file.  Once configured, the application loads the specified inference model's IR files into the [Inference Engine](http://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_IE_DG_Deep_Learning_Inference_Engine_DevGuide.html) and runs the three phases described in the following sections.\n",
    "#### Phase 1:  Pre-processing\n",
    "The frames from the specified input video are read and pre-processed to have the frame data ready for input into inference.  Each frame is resized and its channels are transposed to match the input of the input requirements of the inference model.  The resulting blocks of frame data are written to the binary file `tmp/processed_vid.bin`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Phase 2:  Inference\n",
    "The binary file `tmp/processed_vid.bin` is read for input to inference to detect the specific objects: people, safety vests, and hardhats.  For each detected object within a frame, a message is written as a line to the output text file in the form:\n",
    "```\n",
    "   <frame_id> <xmin> <ymin> <xmax> <ymax> <class_id> <det_label> <det_time>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Where each field reports:\n",
    "- <*frame_id*> - Frame number of results\n",
    "- <*xmin*> - Minimum x coordinate for restriction zone\n",
    "- <*ymin*> - Minimum y coordinate for restriction zone\n",
    "- <*xmax*> - Maximum x coordinate for restriction zone\n",
    "- <*ymax*> - Maximum y coordinate for restriction zone\n",
    "- <*class_id*> - The class identifier (integer) from the inference results \n",
    "- <*det_label*> - Detection label: \"True\" if safe, \"False\" if unsafe\n",
    "- <*det_time*> - Detection time taken to perform inference (\"N/A\" due to using Async API)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Phase 3:  Post-processing\n",
    "After the safety gear detection application has finished running inference, a second executable is run to annotate the input video with the results from the output text file.  The final results is an output video with boxes drawn around detected objects with each box appearing with a label and probability value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sample, we provide three performance numbers for each architecture. However, they are not hard limits on the solution's performance. It is important to understand that for any application, you may want to combine preprocessing, inference, and post-processing, as opposed to separating them as done here. Combined preprocessing has several advantages:\n",
    "- If inference is run asynchronously on the accelerator, the rest of the system is available for parallel tasks for capturing input, preprocessing future frames, or post-processing past frames.\n",
    "- The inference application pipeline has better data locality, allowing for the reuse of data in caches such as in the application's memory or in the hard drive's cache. \n",
    "\n",
    "To run the application on the Intel® DevCloud for the Edge, a job is submitted to an edge compute node with a hardware accelerator such as Intel® HD Graphics GPU and Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick 2.  After inference on the input is completed, the output is stored in the appropriate `results/<architecture>/` directory.  The results are then viewed within this Jupyter* Notebook using the `videoHTML` video playback utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The application and inference code for this sample is already implemented in the Python* files: \n",
    "- First pass, detection using inference: [`safety_gear_detection.py`](./safety_gear_detection.py)\n",
    "- Second pass, annotation using detection results: [`safety_gear_detection_annotate.py`](./safety_gear_detection_annotate.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections will guide you through configuring and running the safety gear detection application."

    "### Create the IR files for the inference model\n",
    "\n",
    "The Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit includes the [Model Optimizer](http://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_MO_DG_Deep_Learning_Model_Optimizer_DevGuide.html) used to convert and optimize trained models into the Intermediate Representation (IR) model files, and the [Inference Engine](http://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_IE_DG_Deep_Learning_Inference_Engine_DevGuide.html) that uses the IR model files to run inference on hardware devices.  The IR model files can be created from trained models from popular frameworks (e.g. Caffe\\*, Tensorflow*, etc.).  For this sample, the Caffe* model is supplied in the directory `/data/reference-sample-data/safety-gear-detection/` which contains the model files:\n",
    "- **worker_safety_mobilenet.prototxt** - The deployed [Protocol Buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) file that describes the network architecture to run inference\n",
    "- **worker_safety_mobilenet.caffemodel** - Binary containing trained weights\n",
    "\n",
    "These files will need to be optimized using the Model Optimizer to create the necessary IR files.  We will be running the inference model on different hardware devices which have different requirements on the precision of the model (see [Inference Engine Supported Model Formats](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_IE_DG_supported_plugins_Supported_Devices.html#supported_model_formats) for details).

    "- **--input_model** : The model's input *.caffemodel* file  (the *.prototxt* with the same base name will be automatically found, otherwise the `--input_proto` argument would need to be specified)\n",
    "- **--model_name** : Output model name to use\n",
    "- **--data_type** : The model's data type and precision (e.g. FP16, FP32, INT8, etc.)\n",
    "- **--o** : Output directory where to store the generated IR model files\n",
    "\n",
    "For converting our model, the complete command will look like the following:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "!mo.py \\\n",

    "    -o models/mobilenet-ssd/<data_precision>\n",
    "```\n",
