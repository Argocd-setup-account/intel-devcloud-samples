### Brain Tumor Segmentation Sample

This example implements a an inference engine based on the U-Net architecture for brain tumor segmentation in MRI scans. The code demonstrates using the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit that allows you to use for inference not only Intel CPUs, but also Intel HD Graphics, Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 and HDDL-R.
