### MSTAR Synthetic Aperature Radar (SAR) Image Classification

This sample showcases the use of OpenVINO to optimize and deploy an internally developed ResNET18 model that classifies Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images associated with 10 separate military vehicle classifiers, such as tanks and armored vehicles. The deployed model processes 3,606 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images across 10 target classifiers in order to benchmark the model Frames Per Second and Seconds per Frame across Intelâ€™s hardware portfolio available on Dev Cloud
